## USER MANUAL - COMPANY ACCOUNT

## 1. INTRODUCTION
1.1. What is RIBO?
RIBO is a relationship intelligence platform built to
help fast-moving teams turn conversations into revenue.
Designed as an execution-focused CRM, RIBO supports the
entire sales journey—from contact and deal management
to follow-ups, invoicing, and payment tracking. Instead
of acting as a passive database, RIBO actively helps
teams stay on track, close deals faster, and build
stronger client relationships.

Built by its founders, Richard Prodigalidad and Robi
Manalo, RIBO gives startups, SMEs, and growth teams the
clarity and control they need to manage sales without
bloated features or complex workflows. With a clean,
modular design and AI-ready foundation, RIBO works
seamlessly across devices—ensuring teams can act on the
right opportunities, at the right time, wherever they
are.

centralized system to manage sales operations, customer
information, and core business processes. It is
designed to support organizations that need consistent
workflows, structured data management, and improved
visibility across daily activities.
The platform is suitable for small to medium-sized
companies, startups, and growing teams that handle
leads, opportunities, products, and transactions within
a single system. RIBO helps reduce reliance on manual
tracking and disconnected tools by providing an

operations.
RIBO is used by company owners, administrators, sales
teams, and operational staff who are responsible for
monitoring performance, maintaining accurate records,
and executing sales-related tasks. The system enables

a structured framework that supports process
standardization while remaining adaptable to different
